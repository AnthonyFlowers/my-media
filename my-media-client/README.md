# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building the tailwind css file

Run this command in the my-media-client directory

`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/App.css -o ./src/output.css --watch`
This will start a process that watches for changes and rebuilds the output.css file
